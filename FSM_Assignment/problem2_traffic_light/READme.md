# Traffic Light Controller Testbench (`tb2.v`)

## Clock & Tick Setup
- **Clock (`clk`)**
  - Period = **10 ns** (`always #5 clk = ~clk;`)
  - Frequency = **100 MHz**

- **Tick (`tick`)**
  - Divider counts 21 clock cycles before asserting `tick`.
  - Effective `tick` frequency:
    ```
    TICK_HZ = 100 MHz / 21 ≈ 4.76 MHz
    ```

## Traffic Light Timing
The controller follows a **5 / 2 / 5 / 2 tick sequence**:

| Phase        | Duration (ticks) |
|--------------|------------------|
| NS Green     | 5 |
| NS Yellow    | 2 |
| EW Green     | 5 |
| EW Yellow    | 2 |

This cycle repeats continuously.

## Verification
- Observed results:
  - After reset, **NS Green** stayed active for 5 ticks.
  - Transitioned to **NS Yellow** for 2 ticks.
  - Then to **EW Green** for 5 ticks.
  - Finally **EW Yellow** for 2 ticks, completing the cycle.
- The full cycle repeated correctly
